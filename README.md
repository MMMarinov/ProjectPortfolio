# Project Portfolio
This folder contains all the projects that I wish to display as a show of my interest to learn and expand my capabilities.

In this repo you'll find the following projects:
## 1. Data Science:
1. Binary Classification - Titianc_SpaceShip <br>
       Description: In this folder you'll find a notebook where I go through and work on a dataset containing personal records where the target variable is whether
       or not the person was transported or not. I process the data by cleaning then evaluating key features and setting up a Train/Test Split.
       Afterwards, I set up an XGBoost model to analyze the features and predict the target variable. <br>

      Key Highlights: <br>
            Exploratory Data Analysis / Data Cleaning / Gradient Boost Decision Tree Model / Cross-Validation / Visualizations
   
## 2. Data Analysis:
1. Trend Tracker Report <br>
       This report is used to identify potential gaps in knowledge and understanding in a selected team. 
       This report can be used to highlight the key areas of improvement and where further training may be needed either on a team scale or individual level.
       It can be used to track improvement over time and to see what changes are occurring historically.<br>

      Key Highlights: <br>
            Monitoring Trends / Evaluating changes on Team and Individual Scale / Highlighting Key Areas of Improvement
           
2. North American Sales Report <br>
       This report looks at the Sales and purchase data across Canada and the US. 
       This report can be used to evaluate how well a product category/line is doing in it's respective country and uncover any key trends found.
       The report specializes in 3 categories and looks at the sales across years, company, and different lines of business.<br>

     Key Highlights: <br>
            Quick evaluation between Countries / Filtering for specific segments of business / Analysis of Sales across several categories

3. North American Payment Interest Report <br>
       This report focuses on the Interest Amount paid from the US and Canada and looks at this information in 3 main categories.
       Interest Amount by Province/State, by Client, and by Payment Date. The goal is to look at the relationship of interest amount with these different categories to drive business decision.

     Key Highlights: <br>
            Identifying relationships with the target variable / Expansive range of visuals and interaction / Forcasting and prediciting future payments

## 3. Data Engineering:
1. Payment to Accounting <br>
       This python script performs an ETL job where the source information stored in a SQL Server Database is extracted, transformed, and sent over to Accounting on a bi-daily basis.<br>

     Key Highlights:<br>
          SQL Query / Manipulates data to gather specifc payment records based on today's date and the last runtime of the script / Loop and generate csv's based on payment records <br>

2. Sales Incurment Query <br>
    The query uses a set of tables and manipulates the information in such a way that the data still required from a depreciated table 
can still be gathered and presented to the key stakeholders. <br>

   Key Highlights: <br>
      Extracting key information from several database tables / Transforming information that served one intended purpose and bending that data structure to work in favour of the business problem / Loading the final result into a report, with an easy to extract output
