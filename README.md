# ProjectPortfolio
This folder contains all the projects that I wish to display to others.

In this repo you'll find the following projects:
1. Titianc_SpaceShip - Binary Classification
  Description: In this folder you'll find a notebook where I go through and work on a dataset containing personal records where the target variable is whether
  or not the person was transported or not. I process the data by cleaning then evaluating key features and setting up a Train/Test Split.
  Afterwards, I set up an XGBoost model to analyze the features and predict the target variable.

  Key Highlights: Data Cleaning / Exploratory Data Analysis / Gradient Boost Decision Tree Model / Cross-Validation / Visualizations
